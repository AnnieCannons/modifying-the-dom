# Modifying the Document Object Model in JavaScript

### The DOM

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface and representation of a structured document. In the context of web development, the DOM specifically refers to the hierarchical, tree-like structure that represents HTML. It provides a way for programs to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents.

### Components of the DOM

1. DOM Manipulation: JavaScript allows you to add, remove, or modify elements and their attributes in the DOM. This is essential for creating and maintaining dynamic web content.

2. Event Handling: You can attach event listeners to DOM elements to respond to events like clicks, keypresses, or form submissions. This enables interactivity and user-driven actions on a web page.
